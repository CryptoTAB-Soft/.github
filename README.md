## Description

### What is USDT flashing?

Flashr is a USDT flashing software designed for experimental use, allowing users to simulate BTC and USDT transactions with various token variants, including Bitcoin Fantom, Wrapped Bitcoin, and USDT (ERC20, BEP20, TRC20). This proof-of-concept application is dummyproof in setup and operation, intended solely for testing purposes. Flash tokens mimic real cryptocurrencies but have limited utilityâ€”they cannot be traded on exchanges due to a lack of liquidity. However, they can be transferred between cold and hardware wallets for demonstration. While these tokens appear identical to genuine assets, their underlying code reveals their simulated nature. Flashr serves as an educational tool for blockchain experimentation, not for real-world transactions or financial gain. Use responsibly and strictly for testing.
